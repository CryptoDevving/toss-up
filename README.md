## toss-up
Decentralized betting Dapp using Chainlink randomness & React frontend. The betting system is a decentralized smartcontract deployed to the Ethereum test network Rikeby for immutability. Application assets are stored on the Interplanetary FileSystem (IPFS) for censorship resistance. Chainlink is being used as an oricle to generate randomness and assess current ETH price at the time of transaction.
