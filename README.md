## toss-up
Decentralized betting platform using Chainlink randomness, Ethereum Smartcontract & React frontend. The betting system is powered by a Smartcontract deployed to an Ethereum test network (Rikeby) for transparency & immutability. Application assets are stored on the Interplanetary FileSystem (IPFS) for censorship resistance. Chainlink is being used by the contract as an oricle to generate randomness and determine ETH and Wei to USD price at the time of transaction.

#### Ethereum

The TossUp Smartcontract is deployed live on the Rinkeby Ethereum testnet: [ [0x37465edC8~](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x37465edc8d70e4b16033fae23088b1c703924a80#internaltx) ]. The Smartcontract itself is funded with ETH & LINK, which is used to payout winning bets and in exchange for data from Chainlink oracles. The Smartcontract declares the 50% chance in a transparent way, as well as recording each transaction in an immutable decentralized ledger. The betting system is based on a 50% chance equation where a random hash is generated by the Chainlink network to match above or below the halfway mark of possible hashes.

###### Declaring 50% chance, (0.5*(uint256+1))

    uint256 constant half =
        57896044618658097711785492504343953926634992332820282019728792003956564819968;

###### uint256 (uint is an alias) is a unsigned integer which has:

    minimum value of 0
    maximum value of 2^256-1 = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564
    039457584007913129639935 //78 decimal digits

###### Send rewards to the winners
    function verdict(uint256 random) public payable onlyVFRC {
        // Check bets from latest betting round, one by one
        for (uint256 i = lastGameId; i < gameId; i++) {
            // Reset winAmount for current user
            uint256 winAmount = 0;

            // If user wins, then receives 2x of their betting amount
            if (
                (random >= half && games[i].bet == 1) ||
                (random < half && games[i].bet == 0)
            ) {
                winAmount = games[i].amount * 2;
                games[i].player.transfer(winAmount);
            }
            emit Result(
                games[i].id,
                games[i].bet,
                games[i].seed,
                games[i].amount,
                games[i].player,
                winAmount,
                random,
                block.timestamp
            );
        }
        // Save current gameId to lastGameId for the next betting round
        lastGameId = gameId;
    }

#### IPFS

    coming soon

#### Chainlink

Chainlink is being used to provide randomness, and thus, fairness to the betting platform. Chainlink nodes are also being used as an oracle or _reliable_ source of information related to the live price of ETH and Wei in USD.

###### Request for randomness

    function getRandomNumber(uint256 userProvidedSeed)
        internal
        returns (bytes32 requestId)
    {
        require(
            LINK.balanceOf(address(this)) > fee,
            "Error, not enough LINK - fill contract with faucet"
        );
        return requestRandomness(keyHash, fee, userProvidedSeed);
    }

###### Callback function used by VRF Coordinator

    function fulfillRandomness(bytes32 requestId, uint256 randomness)
        internal
        override
    {
        randomResult = randomness;

        // Send final random value to the verdict();
        verdict(randomResult);
    }

###### Returns latest ETH/USD price from Chainlink oracles
    function ethInUsd() public view returns (int256) {
        (
            uint80 roundId,
            int256 price,
            uint256 startedAt,
            uint256 timeStamp,
            uint80 answeredInRound
        ) = ethUsd.latestRoundData();

        return price;
    }

    /* ethUsd - latest price from Chainlink oracles (ETH in USD * 10**8).
     * weiUsd - USD in Wei, received by dividing:
     *          ETH in Wei (converted to compatibility with etUsd (10**18 * 10**8)),
     *          by ethUsd.
     */
    function weiInUsd() public view returns (uint256) {
        int256 ethUsd = ethInUsd();
        int256 weiUsd = 10**26 / ethUsd;

        return uint256(weiUsd);
    }
