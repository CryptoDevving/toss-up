## toss-up
Decentralized betting platform using Chainlink randomness & React frontend. The betting system is a decentralized Smartcontract deployed to an Ethereum test network (Rikeby) for transparency & immutability. Application assets are stored on the Interplanetary FileSystem (IPFS) for censorship resistance. Chainlink is being used by the contract as an oricle to generate randomness and determine ETH price at the time of transaction.

#### Ethereum

The TossUp Smartcontract is deployed live on the Rinkeby testnet: [ [0x37465edC8~](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x37465edc8d70e4b16033fae23088b1c703924a80#internaltx) ]. The Smartcontract itself is funded with ETH & LINK, which is used to payout winning bets as well as fund processing power from a Chainlink node. The Smartcontract declares the 50% chance in a transparent way, as well as recording each transaction in an immutable decentralized ledger.

The betting system is based on a 50% chance equation where a random hash is generated by the Chainlink network to match above or below the halfway mark of possible hashes.

    // Declaring 50% chance, (0.5*(uint256+1))
    uint256 constant half =
        57896044618658097711785492504343953926634992332820282019728792003956564819968;

uint256 (uint is an alias) is a unsigned integer which has:

    minimum value of 0
    maximum value of 2^256-1 = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564

#### Chainlink

Chainlink is being used to provide randomness, and thus, fairness to the betting platform. Chainlink nodes are also being used as an oracle or _reliable_ source of information related to the live price of ETH and LINK.

The following functions are used to obtain randomness from the Chainlink network:

###### Request for randomness

    function getRandomNumber(uint256 userProvidedSeed)
        internal
        returns (bytes32 requestId)
    {
        require(
            LINK.balanceOf(address(this)) > fee,
            "Error, not enough LINK - fill contract with faucet"
        );
        return requestRandomness(keyHash, fee, userProvidedSeed);
    }

###### Callback function used by VRF Coordinator

    function fulfillRandomness(bytes32 requestId, uint256 randomness)
        internal
        override
    {
        randomResult = randomness;

        // Send final random value to the verdict();
        verdict(randomResult);
    }

#### Requirements

#### Installation
